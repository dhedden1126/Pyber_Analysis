# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
This analysis is meant to evaluate aspects of the ride sharing business in multiple ways. We will take a look at average fares per ride & driver, total drivers, and rides. We can then escalate recommendations to other stakeholders within the orgranization to assist with decision making. 

#### Total Rides
- Ride volume is dominated by Urban city types due to the amount of people and destinations those areas have to offer. 
- Rural rides only make up ~5% of the total ride counts, while suburban and urban city types contribute ~26% and ~68% respectively.

#### Fares per Ride
- Average fares per ride increase as you move away from urban areas to communities that have their populations spread out over a wider distance. This is expected due to the distance between destinations tends to be greater in Rural than Urban areas.

#### Average Fare per Driver
- This metric shows may show how well your drivers are getting paid by the amount of staff (drivers) that are employed. 
- Being that Urban areas show a decrease in Average Fare per Driver versus Average Fare per Ride may suggest that there may be market saturation. 

#### Trends Over Time
- Rural total fares have been the only segment of the market that has made new highs in each month.
- Urban areas look to show strength during an ~30 day window from end of February to mid-March.
- Suburban areas look relatively flat in the first four months of the year.
