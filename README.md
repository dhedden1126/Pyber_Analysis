# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
This analysis is meant to evaluate aspects of the ride sharing business in multiple ways. We will take a look at average fares per ride & driver, total drivers, and rides. We can then escalate recommendations to other stakeholders within the orgranization to assist with decision making.

#### Total Rides
- Ride volume is dominated by Urban city types due to the amount of people and destinations those areas have to offer. 
- Rural rides only make up ~5% of the total ride counts, while suburban and urban city types contribute ~26% and ~68% respectively.

#### Fares per Ride
- Average fares per ride increase as you move away from urban areas to communities that have their populations spread out over a wider distance. This is expected due to the distance between destinations tends to be greater in Rural than Urban areas.

#### Average Fare per Driver
- This metric shows may show how well your drivers are getting paid by the amount of staff (drivers) that are employed. 
- Being that Urban areas show a decrease in Average Fare per Driver versus Average Fare per Ride may suggest that there may be market saturation. 

#### Trends Over Time
- Rural total fares have been the only segment of the market that has made new highs in each month.
- Urban areas look to show strength during an ~30 day window from end of February to mid-March.
- Suburban areas look relatively flat in the first four months of the year.

## Business Recommendations
1. The first recommendation is to conduct a cost benefit analysis to determine how to optimize staffing across the three city types. 
2. Identifying areas of the business that provide an opportunity to increase fares in Urban markets would assist in increasing revenues
3. Due to the increase in total fares across all three city types from January to end of February, ensure we are staffed & trainined prior to that time frame
